Soda - ScriptableObject Dependency Architecture
===============================================

Hello and thank you for purchasing Soda!
Here's a very quick readme to get you started:

* Using Soda can profoundly change the way you structure your Unity projects.
   Of course, feel free to use it however you like; but it is *highly* recommended that you read the included manual pdf
   to get a true understanding of what Soda can do for you (and also how to *not* use it).
* You can find the API documentation here: http://soda.13pixels.de/
* For questions, feedback and discussions, feel free to join the 13Pixels Slack workspace: http://13pixels.de/slack

Have a productive time!
